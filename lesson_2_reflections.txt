What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository it sets it up so you can start logging your
changes. You need to initialize the repository so Git knows to start
logging changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows the changes to be tracked so you can do a commit on 
the file(s). It allows you to work track specific files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
You can check the file in the staging area by using command git diff --staged 
to see what changes where made.
